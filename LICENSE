 Copyright (C) 2024  Udayah.in
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                     **AGPL-3.0 License Summary**

 This license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions
 of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users. The AGPL
 requires that any program that is modified and used to provide a service over a
 network must also be made available to the users of that service.

 **Terms and Conditions**

0. Definitions.

   This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed
   by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this
   General Public License. The "Program," below, refers to any such program or work,
   and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
   under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of
   it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
   (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification.")
   Each licensee is addressed as "you."

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like rights such as similar rights relating to
   data or database rights.

   "The Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.

   "You" means an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this
   License. "License" means this document.

1. Source Code.

   The Program must include a copy of this License, and must be distributed along
   with the source code of the Program. If the Program is distributed in object code
   form, the corresponding source code must be made available under the same terms
   as the Program itself.

2. Fair Use.

   This License does not grant you permission to use the work for commercial purposes
   without proper authorization from the copyright holder.

3. Modified Versions.

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
   forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
   under the terms of this License, provided that you also meet all of these
   conditions:
   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
   you changed the files and the date of any change.
   b) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
   who receives a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with the copyright,
   to the whole of the work, and all its parts.

4. Sharing via Network.

   You may also offer the Program as a service over a network. When you do this, you
   must offer the users of the service access to the source code of the Program under
   the terms of this License.

5. No Warranty.

   The Program is distributed without any warranty; without even the implied warranty
   of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. See the GNU General Public
   License for more details.

6. Acceptance.

   You must accept this License in order to use the Program. You may not use, copy,
   modify, or distribute the Program or any work based on it, except as expressly
   provided under this License.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   There is no warranty for this software. Use at your own risk.

8. Termination.

   If you fail to comply with this License, your rights under this License will
   terminate automatically.

9. Additional Terms.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by this License.
   However, you may have additional agreements with other licensees as long as they
   do not contradict the terms of this License.

10. Copyleft.

   This License is designed to ensure that all derivative works remain free and open
   to the public.
